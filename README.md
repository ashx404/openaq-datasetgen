# openaq-datasetgen
OpenAQ-datasetgen allows you to generate a latest air quality data of all the stations supported by the API in a country and it stores them into a .txt file which can be further converted into .XLS/.CSV as the data is in JSON format.Script is fairly easier to run just change the parameters 'countryCode' and 'limit' and you are ready to go. Please remember OpenAQ API allows only about 2000 requests over a 5 minute time period on a single IP.
